##  Spawns.txt reference   ##
#############################

# This file is part of the MERVBot database collection.
# Changes made while the bot is running will NOT be lost.

# Lines beginning with non-alphanumeric characters ('#', '$', etc) are comments.

# Spawns:
# In this file you specify the name(s) your initial bot(s)
# will use, and what its/their staff password(s) will be.

# WARNING: As a rule of thumb, you can never host more than 3 bots in one zone,
#          unless the bot is hosted on the same computer as the subspace server.

# Spawns.txt Format:
# Bot name : Bot password : Arena name : Plugin names : Staff password : Creation string

# NOTE: creation string shoudl always, always, always, always be of the following format:
# dll_name parameters|dll_name parameters|...
#
# Example: flagbot -f=4 -t=10|aliasbot -m=0|goalkeeper goals=2
#
# Only bots that explicitly support the creation string will be able to use it

# 0. Bot names will be checked for validity prior to connecting.
# 1. Bot passwords and arenas may not contain a colon (':').
# 2. If staff password is blank, the bot will still attempt to use it.
# 3. Bots do not append staff password to name password, in other words
#    it is safe to change staff position of an older bot.
# 4. Staff passwords are case-sensitive and shouldn't start with *.
# 5. Separate the plugin names with commas: CTF, ELIZA, ALIAS
# 6. Other login settings are defined in the INI file.

# White-space:
# White-space (' ') is ignored before and after colons (':')
# Ex. 5 : Catid   :   Password  is the same as 5:Catid:Password
